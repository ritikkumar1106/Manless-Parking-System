# Manless-Parking-System
Manless Parking System (Console-based) is a C++ project designed to simulate an automated parking system within a console environment. This simple project serves as a demonstration of key parking system functionalities.

# Features
**1. Automated Parking:** Simulates an automated parking process where vehicles can be parked and retrieved without manual intervention.

**2. Parking Space Management:** Manage and monitor the availability of parking spaces.

**3. Simple User Interface:** Console-based interface for users to interact with the parking system.


# Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the Console-based Manless Parking System on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
1. C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
2. Make sure the C++11 standard is supported by your compiler.

# Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**

	git clone https://github.com/your-username/Manless-Parking-System.git

**2. Navigate to the project directory:**

	cd Manless-Parking-System

**3. Compile the project:**

	g++ main.cpp -o Manless-Parking-System

**4. Run the executable:**

	./Manless-Parking-System

# Usage
1. Follow on-screen prompts to navigate through the parking system simulation.
2. Park and retrieve vehicles to see the automated process in action.
3. Monitor parking space availability and system status.
